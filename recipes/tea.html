        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I feel a little silly saying I just discovered tea. Humans have been drinking it for thousands of years and it’s only the second most consumed drink in the world behind water. And I myself have enjoyed tea in some form every day of my life since I could hold a sippy cup. So I was already a fan of tea, however, what I just discovered was how to make tea much better.</p>
        <p>I had 6 cups of that tea over the next 4 days. Every time I was surprised how good it tasted. It had a floral quality like a bunch of fresh rose petals and even a subtle citrus-like thing going on. I drink a lot of iced tea and it reminded me of really good iced tea that I’ve had in the past. Come to think of it it’s been a long time since I’ve had a great glass of iced tea.</p>
